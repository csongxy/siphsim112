## Siphonophore Simulator About
> ⭐ Created as a project for CMU'S 15-122, this game has the player take control of a siphnophore, a colonial organism which for the sake of game design has had many facts simplified. As a class assignment and my first larger project, this game was compleated within the span of 2.5 weeks and thus not all desired features are implemented. A cleaned up version is published here.
#### Implemented features including but not limited to:
>+ Default hoovering animation implemented using sinusoidal properties
>+ Use WASD or arrow keys to move the siphonophore around and stay alive
>+ changing scenery to match changes in sea-level
>+ A variety of automaticaly and randomly generated prey to capture
>+ A Starvation mechanic which decreases the length of the siphonophore when hunger is below a certain level.
>+ Similarly, when hunger is full, it is possible for the siphonophore to grow in length.
>+ Predators may consume a chunk of the siphonophore
>+ Instructions, Extra info, and control menus
>+ Ability to customize enviromental and siphonophore related factors via sliders
### How to Run:
