Project Name: Siphonophore Simulator
            --> Play as a siphonophore, a colonial organism that for the sake 
                of game design has had many facts simplified.
            --> Use WASD or arrow keys to move the siphonophore around and stay alive
            --> Catch prey while staying in your natural habitat
            --> But be sure to keep an eye on your hunger and avoid predators
How to Run:
        --> open the 15_112_Tp1.py file and hit command + B to run the program
ShortCut Commands:
        --> c to activate/deactivate a mode in which the siphonophore can't die
        --> p to pause/unpause the simulation
        --> open the control panel to fiddle around with enviroment settings!
Fonts/Libraries?:
        --> CMU Graphics
        --> math and random,
